We distribute with our prototype the following datasets form Machine
Learning repository archive, http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/:

- adult: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
- census: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income
- forestcover: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype
- kdd99: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/KDD+Cup+1999+Data
- tic-tac-toe: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tic-Tac-Toe+Endgame

The mcsherry-adult.txt dataset is the version of adult used in the
MWEM paper.

The datasets are under data/compressed.

Please uncompress the data files before running dualquery and more the
$DATA.clean files to the top-level data directory.

We have pre-processed the datasets to discretize continuous attributes
and to normalize discrete attributes into a 0..N integer represenation
using the encode.pl script.

Netflix data:
============

The Nexflix prize data set is no longer re-distributable.

If you have it, you can use the netflix-parser utility that we ship to
produce an input dataset in a format our tool understands.

netflix-parser produces a binary dataset where each row represents a
user and each column a movie, which is set to 1 if the user watched
that particular movie.

Query cache:
===========

The actual queries used along with their evaluations can be found in
the qcache/ directory.

Please uncompress the query cache files before running dualquery.
